**# Our Moodle Upgrade Plan: A Simple Guide for the Future**

## **Introduction**
Moodle is the system we use to manage online learning, and it gets updates regularly to add new features, fix issues, or keep it safe. We’ve created a plan to update our Moodle site smoothly, balancing careful testing with quick action when needed. This guide explains how we’ll handle upgrades in the future, written so everyone—technical or not—can follow along. It’s built for our small team to keep things running well for our clients.

---

## **Moodle’s Update Schedule**
Moodle releases two types of updates:

- **Major Updates**: These happen twice a year (April and October) and bring big changes, like new tools or visual improvements.
- **Minor Updates**: These come every two months and usually fix small problems or add security improvements.

We base our plan on Moodle’s schedule but adjust it to fit our team and needs. Here’s how it works.

## **Our Upgrade Process: Step by Step**
We’ve split this into clear steps to ensure updates go smoothly, whether they’re big or small.

### **Step 1: Monitoring for Updates**
- We track Moodle’s official announcements and release notes to stay informed about upcoming updates.
- We assess each update’s impact, checking for security patches, new features, or compatibility changes.
- Before applying any update, we create full backups of our Moodle site, including files, databases, and configurations.

### **Step 2: Testing and Validation**
- We set up a **staging environment** identical to our live site to test new updates safely.
- **Testing Timeline:**
  - **Major updates:** 2-3 weeks of testing to check core features, plugins, themes, and custom developments.
  - **Minor updates:** 1-2 weeks of testing with a focus on security and stability.
- We document any issues found and apply necessary fixes before moving forward.

### **Step 3: Deployment to Production**
- We schedule updates during low-traffic periods (e.g., weekends or late nights) to minimize disruption.
- **Deployment Process:**
  1. Enable **Maintenance Mode** to inform users about ongoing work.
  2. Apply the update and run post-update checks.
  3. Disable Maintenance Mode and monitor performance.
- **Timing:**
  - **Major Updates:** Implemented about a month after release to allow thorough testing.
  - **Minor Updates:** Security patches applied within 1-2 weeks; other minor updates within a month.

### **Step 4: Communicating with Stakeholders**
- We notify clients in advance about scheduled updates, expected downtime, and benefits of the update.
- After deployment, we provide release notes and highlight any important changes or new features.

## **Upgrade Schedule: Moodle vs. Ours**

| Type of Update  | Frequency        | Moodle’s Timing  | Our Timing  |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Major Updates** | Twice a year    | April & October | ~One month later (May & November) |
| **Minor Updates** | Every two months | Feb, Apr, Jun, Aug, Oct, Dec | 1-2 weeks for security fixes; ~1 month for others |

**Example:** If Moodle releases a big update in April, we’ll test it and update our site by May. If a security fix is released in December, we’ll apply it within 1-2 weeks.

---

## **Additional Considerations**
### **Rollback Plan (In Case of Issues)**
- If an update causes unexpected issues, we will **revert to the backup** and troubleshoot before retrying.
- We maintain a **version history** of updates for reference and rollback decisions.

### **Plugin and Theme Compatibility**
- We ensure that third-party plugins and themes remain compatible with new updates before applying them.
- If necessary, we contact vendors for updates or find alternative solutions.

### **Performance and Security Audits**
- After each update, we conduct security and performance audits to detect vulnerabilities or slowdowns.
- We monitor system logs and user feedback to catch any lingering issues.

---

## **What Could Go Wrong?**
- **Delaying security updates too long**: We’ll prioritize urgent patches to minimize risks.
- **Clients seeing features elsewhere first**: We’ll explain that thorough testing ensures stability.
- **Unexpected technical issues**: We’ll have backup and rollback plans to restore service quickly.

---

## **Wrapping Up**
This plan keeps our Moodle site up-to-date, secure, and running smoothly. By following structured testing, careful deployment, and proactive communication, we ensure minimal disruptions. This simple yet effective approach fits our small team and maintains client trust. We’ll update this guide as our process evolves!
